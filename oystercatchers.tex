\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Often you will receive complex data-sets, but initial analyses can be
confusing, and it may require careful interpretation of model outputs to
understand what is the problem. This practical will use a real
ecological dataset to illustrate some of the problems. You can learn
about fine-tuning and polishing ggplot2 graphics in numerous books and
websites, and I particularly recommend The R Cookbook
\url{http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/} which contains the same text as
the associated book. The book R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham
(author of ggplot2 etc.) and its website
\url{https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html} are also excellent sources. The
aims of this practical are to: * show you how to explore ecological
data, with common mistakes * use diagnostic plots to gain better
insights

\subsection{The data}\label{the-data}

The data are from a 3-year study into American oystercatchers,
\emph{Haematopus palliatus}, inhabitating coastal areas near Buenos
Aires, Argentina. Oystercatchers establish nesting territories along the
shoreline, of about 50 to 500 metres in size, and when chicks are being
reared these are defended by adults, with the parents chasing away other
oystercatchers. We will look at a sub-set of the data, for two months,
December and January, when the birds are breeding (southern hemispher
summer).

Oystercatchers use two techniques to break open clam shells, either a
hammering technique or stabbing method. One question in the study was
whether the shells eaten by hammerers are larger than those eaten by
stabbers. Time of year, and location may also affect what is happening,
so we could be looking at a complex 3-way interaction between feeding
type (stabber/hammerer), feeding plot and month.

\subsection{Including Plots}\label{including-plots}

You can also embed plots, for example:

\includegraphics{oystercatchers_files/figure-latex/pressure-1.pdf}

Note that the \texttt{echo\ =\ FALSE} parameter was added to the code
chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
